# Academic-Management-System
An Academic Management System is an online system which enables
streamlining of all academic activities in an academic institution. This
system automates various academic processes of the institution and will
enhance the efficiency of the system by saving valuable time and
efforts that go into manual processing.<br><br>
The aim is to build an up-and-running web-application of an Academic
Management System. We want to increase consistency in academic
activities (for eg. conducting examinations of students, notifying
students by broadcasting important information, displaying a
dashboard for all students to track their academic activities in their
current academic year) so as to increase efficiency of admins and
employees by allowing them to focus on more important work. Weâ€™re
trying to develop this web-app to work regardless of any scale, be it on
a tiny scale of a school or a huge scale of a university.
